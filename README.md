## [handOver](https://hand-over.vercel.app) ~ by Amit

**handOver** is platform to connect peeps who wanted to exchange their resource books or other items but they faced some bad experience in finding someone with items they needed to exchange, and that's what **handOver** aims to solve!

**handOver** is not an e-commerce site, it's more like a barter system.

You got some books to exchange with other batch students? **handOver** welcomes you! Choose a resonable price and make it open for exchange, an indeed will figure you out.
